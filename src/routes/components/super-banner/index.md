# SuperBanner

A super-banner communicates a high-priority state that affects an entire app, experience, process, or system. It is displayed prominently at the very top of the page, above all other content, to ensure maximum visibility for critical messages.

This headless component uses a `<div>` element with `role="alert"` for immediate screen reader announcement of high-priority information.

## Implementation Notes

- Uses `<div>` element with `role="alert"` for immediate screen reader announcement
- `aria-live="assertive"` interrupts current speech to announce the message
- Positioned at the top of the page above all other content
- May include a dismiss button for user-dismissable banners

## Props

- `label`: string (optional) -- accessible label for the super banner
- `dismissable`: boolean (default: false) -- whether the banner can be dismissed
- `ondismiss`: callback (optional) -- handler called when banner is dismissed
- `children`: slot (required) -- banner content
- `...restProps`: Any additional HTML attributes

## Usage

```html
<SuperBanner label="System outage">
  Our payment processing service is currently unavailable. We are working to restore it.
</SuperBanner>
```

```html
<SuperBanner label="Scheduled maintenance" dismissable ondismiss={handleDismiss}>
  Planned maintenance on Saturday 12 April from 02:00 to 06:00 UTC. Save your work before then.
</SuperBanner>
```

```html
<SuperBanner label="Security alert">
  Your password was changed from a new device. If this was not you,
  <a href="/account/security">review your account security</a> immediately.
</SuperBanner>
```

## Keyboard Interactions

- Tab: Focus the dismiss button (if dismissable)
- Enter/Space: Dismiss the banner (if dismissable)

## ARIA

- `role="alert"` -- announces the banner content immediately to screen readers
- `aria-live="assertive"` -- interrupts current speech for high-priority messages
- `aria-label` -- optional description of the banner purpose

## When to Use

- Use to communicate a high-priority state that affects the entire application, such as a system outage or emergency alert
- Use for global maintenance notices that must be visible on every page
- Use when the message requires immediate attention and cannot be missed, such as a security incident or data breach notification
- Use for regulatory or legal notices that must interrupt the user experience until acknowledged

## When Not to Use

- Do not use for page-specific messages -- use Banner instead
- Do not use for form validation errors -- use ErrorSummary to summarize field errors
- Do not use for success confirmations -- use Banner with a success variant or Alert
- Do not use for routine notifications -- use Notification or Toast for transient messages

## Headless

This component provides a `<div>` with `role="alert"` and `aria-live="assertive"` for immediate screen reader announcements, with zero visual styling. The consumer is responsible for all CSS including background color, text color, positioning, dismiss button, and responsive behavior.

## Styles

The consumer provides all CSS styling. The component renders with a `.super-banner` class for targeting. No default styles are included -- this is a fully headless component.

## Testing

- Verify the component renders a `<div>` element with class `super-banner`
- Verify `role="alert"` is present
- Verify `aria-live="assertive"` is present
- Verify dismiss functionality works when dismissable
- Verify pass-through attributes are applied

## Advice

- **Designers**: Use bold, high-contrast colors to distinguish super banners from regular content. Keep the message concise and actionable. Position at the very top of the viewport.
- **Developers**: Use `role="alert"` for critical messages that need immediate attention. Provide a dismiss mechanism for non-persistent messages.
