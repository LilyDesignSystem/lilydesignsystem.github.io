# Kanban Table

A Kanban board is a component that organizes work items into columns representing different stages of a workflow, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." Commonly used in project management tools, agile development platforms, and task tracking applications, the Kanban board provides a visual overview of work status and flow, helping teams identify bottlenecks and prioritize tasks.

This headless component renders a `<div>` with `role="region"` and an accessible label, defining a semantic boundary for the board. The consumer provides the column structure, card content, and any drag-and-drop or keyboard-based item movement as children.

## Implementation Notes

- Renders a `<div>` with `role="region"` to define a named landmark for the Kanban board
- Consumer provides column containers and item cards as children
- The region role with a label allows screen reader users to navigate directly to the board
- Accepts `...restProps` for forwarding additional attributes to the container
- No internal state -- purely a structural wrapper

## Props

- `label`: string (required) -- accessible name describing the board, applied via `aria-label`
- `children`: slot (required) -- the board content including columns and cards

## Usage

Sprint board with three workflow stages:

```html
<KanbanTable label="Sprint 5 board">
    <KanbanTableHead>
        <KanbanTableRow>
            <KanbanTableTD>To Do</KanbanTableTD>
            <KanbanTableTD>In Progress</KanbanTableTD>
            <KanbanTableTD>Done</KanbanTableTD>
        </KanbanTableRow>
    </KanbanTableHead>
    <KanbanTableBody>
        <KanbanTableRow>
            <KanbanTableTD label="Fix login bug">Fix login bug</KanbanTableTD>
            <KanbanTableTD label="Add dashboard">Add dashboard</KanbanTableTD>
            <KanbanTableTD label="Setup CI/CD">Setup CI/CD</KanbanTableTD>
        </KanbanTableRow>
    </KanbanTableBody>
</KanbanTable>
```

## Keyboard Interactions

None built-in -- the consumer should implement keyboard interactions for moving items between columns and navigating within the board as appropriate.

## ARIA

- `role="region"` -- defines the Kanban board as a named landmark section
- `aria-label={label}` -- provides an accessible name for the board region

## When to Use

- Use for organising items by status in a board layout, such as project tasks (To Do, In Progress, Done).
- Use when teams need a visual overview of work status, flow, and bottlenecks.
- Use in project management tools, agile sprint boards, and task tracking applications.
- Use when items need to move between workflow stages.

## When Not to Use

- Do not use for general tabular data -- use Table or DataTable instead.
- Do not use for timeline scheduling -- use GanttTable instead.
- Do not use for simple task lists without workflow stages -- use TaskList or CheckList instead.

## Headless

This headless component provides a `<div>` with `role="region"` and `aria-label` for defining a named landmark for the Kanban board. The consumer provides all visual styling including column layout, card design, drag-and-drop interactions, and status color coding.


## Styles

The consumer provides all CSS styling. The component renders with a `.kanban-table` class for targeting. No default styles are included — this is a fully headless component.


## Testing


- Verify the component renders a `<table>` element with class `kanban-table`
- Verify role="region"` -- defines the Kanban board as a named landmark section
- Verify aria-label={label}` -- provides an accessible name for the board region
- Verify pass-through attributes are applied

## Advice

- **Designers**: Use distinct column backgrounds or headers to clearly separate workflow stages. Design cards with consistent layout showing title, assignee, and priority.
- **Developers**: Implement keyboard-based item movement between columns for accessibility. The consumer is responsible for drag-and-drop and column management.

## Composition

KanbanTable uses the Table composition pattern: KanbanTable contains KanbanTableHead, KanbanTableBody, and optionally KanbanTableFoot. Each section contains KanbanTableRow elements, which contain KanbanTableTD cells representing items in each workflow column. Use KanbanTableTD for column-level styling.
