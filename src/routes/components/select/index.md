# Select

A select is a headless component that wraps the native HTML `<select>` element, providing a dropdown menu for choosing one option from a list. It is commonly used in forms for selecting a country, category, status, or any other value from a predefined set of choices.

The consumer provides `<option>` elements as children, giving full control over the available choices. The component uses `aria-label` for accessible naming and supports two-way binding on the selected value.

## Implementation Notes

- Renders a single `<select>` element containing consumer-provided `<option>` children
- Uses `aria-label` for accessible naming instead of a visible `<label>` element
- Supports two-way binding on the `value` prop
- Uses slot for the `children` prop to render `<option>` elements
- Spreads `restProps` onto the select element for consumer extensibility

## Props

- `label`: string (required) -- accessible name applied via `aria-label`
- `value`: string (default: "") -- bindable string representing the currently selected value
- `required`: boolean (default: false) -- whether the select is required for form submission
- `disabled`: boolean (default: false) -- whether the select is disabled
- `children`: slot (required) -- `<option>` elements to render inside the select
- `...restProps`: unknown -- additional attributes spread onto the select element

## Usage

```html
<Field label="Sort by">
  <Select label="Sort by">
    <Option value="recently-published" selected>Recently published</Option>
    <Option value="recently-updated">Recently updated</Option>
    <Option value="most-views">Most views</Option>
  </Select>
</Field>

<Field label="Choose your region">
  <Hint>This can be different to what you selected before</Hint>
  <Select label="Choose your region">
    <Option value="">Choose region</Option>
    <Option value="east">East of England</Option>
    <Option value="london">London</Option>
    <Option value="midlands">Midlands</Option>
    <Option value="northwest">North West</Option>
    <Option value="southeast">South East</Option>
  </Select>
</Field>
```

## Keyboard Interactions

- Tab: Moves focus to and from the select element (native browser behavior)
- Space/Enter: Opens the dropdown list when focused (native browser behavior)
- Arrow Up/Down: Navigates through options (native browser behavior)
- Escape: Closes the dropdown list (native browser behavior)
- Home/End: Jumps to first/last option (native browser behavior)
- Type-ahead: Typing characters jumps to matching options (native browser behavior)

## ARIA

- `aria-label={label}` -- provides an accessible name for the select element since there is no visible `<label>` element
- The `<select>` element implicitly has `role="combobox"` or `role="listbox"` depending on the browser, with built-in accessible semantics

## When to Use

- Use as a last resort when RadioGroup is not practical due to a very long list of options
- Use for settings where a sensible default can be pre-selected, such as a sort order or display preference
- Use when screen space is limited and a compact dropdown is needed
- Use with a descriptive label and optional Hint to help users understand the available choices

## When Not to Use

- Do not use when there are fewer than 7 options -- use RadioGroup with RadioInput instead, which is easier to use
- Do not use the multiple selection attribute -- use CheckboxGroup with CheckboxInput for multi-select
- Do not pre-select an option for question-based inputs -- this can bias user responses
- Do not use when users need to search or filter options -- use Combobox or SelectWithExtras instead

## Headless

The Select headless component provides a native `<select>` element with `aria-label` for accessible naming and two-way value binding. Consumer-provided `<option>` children define the available choices. The browser handles all keyboard navigation and dropdown behavior. The consumer provides all visual styling.


## Styles

The consumer provides all CSS styling. The component renders with a `.select` class for targeting. No default styles are included — this is a fully headless component.


## Testing


- Verify the component renders a `<select>` element with class `select`
- Verify aria-label={label}` -- provides an accessible name for the select element since there is no visible `<label>` element
- Verify The `<select>` element implicitly has `role="combobox"` or `role="listbox"` depending on the browser, with built-in accessible semantics
- Verify keyboard interactions work correctly
- Verify pass-through attributes are applied

## Advice

- **Designers**: Include a placeholder option (e.g., "Select a country...") as the first item to guide users, and avoid overly long option lists that are hard to scan.
- **Developers**: Set the placeholder option's `value` to an empty string and combine with the `required` prop to enforce selection, ensuring form validation works correctly.
