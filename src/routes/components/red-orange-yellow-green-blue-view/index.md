# Red Orange Yellow Green Blue View

A ROYGB (Red/Orange/Yellow/Green/Blue) view is a component that displays a five-level color-coded status value as read-only text. It is used to present previously captured ROYGB status data in dashboards, reports, or detail views. Red indicates a critical problem, orange signals a hazard, yellow means caution, green indicates normal status, and blue represents a paused or informational state.

The component renders as a `<span>` element with an accessible label, making the status readable by screen readers and other assistive technologies. This headless component provides the semantic structure and accessibility features while allowing consumers to apply their own visual styling. The five-level scale offers more granularity than the traditional three-level RAG (Red/Amber/Green) status pattern.

## Implementation Notes

- Renders as `<span aria-label={label}>` displaying a ROYGB status value as text content
- Five-level status scale: red, orange, yellow, green, blue
- Read-only display component, not interactive
- Value defaults to an empty string when not provided
- Uses props rune for prop destructuring
- Spreads `...restProps` on the `<span>` element for consumer extensibility
- No hardcoded user-facing strings; label and value are fully configurable

## Props

- `label`: string (required) -- accessible label for screen readers via `aria-label`
- `value`: string (default: `""`) -- the ROYGB status to display (e.g., "red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue")
- `...restProps`: any additional HTML attributes spread onto the `<span>` element

## Usage

Display a five-level status in a report:

```html
<RedOrangeYellowGreenBlueView label="Risk level" value="yellow" />
```

Display dynamic status in a summary list:

```html
<SummaryList>
  <SummaryListItem>
    <dt>Alert status</dt>
    <dd><RedOrangeYellowGreenBlueView label="Alert status" value={level} /></dd>
  </SummaryListItem>
</SummaryList>
```

With data attribute for CSS colour coding:

```html
<RedOrangeYellowGreenBlueView label="Patient triage" value="orange" data-value="orange" />
```

## Keyboard Interactions

None -- this is a passive informational display, not an interactive element.

## ARIA

- `aria-label={label}` -- provides the accessible name for the status display, allowing screen readers to announce the context of the value

## When to Use

- Use to display a five-level colour status in read-only format in dashboards and reports.
- Use in summary cards and detail views where the ROYGB status has already been captured.
- Use when presenting historical or locked status data that should not be edited.
- Use in tables and lists to show five-level status alongside other data fields.

## When Not to Use

- Do not use when users need to select or change the status -- use [RedOrangeYellowGreenBluePicker](../red-orange-yellow-green-blue-picker/) instead.
- Do not use for three-level status display -- use [RedAmberGreenView](../red-amber-green-view/) instead.
- Do not use for general-purpose text display -- use a `<span>` or [Badge](../badge/) instead.

## Headless

The RedOrangeYellowGreenBlueView headless component provides a `<span>` with `aria-label` for accessible naming and displays the ROYGB status value as text content. The consumer provides all visual styling, including color-coded backgrounds, text colors, or icons.


## Styles

The consumer provides all CSS styling. The component renders with a `.red-orange-yellow-green-blue-view` class for targeting. No default styles are included — this is a fully headless component.


## Testing


- Verify the component renders a `<div>` element with class `red-orange-yellow-green-blue-view`
- Verify aria-label={label}` -- provides the accessible name for the status display, allowing screen readers to announce the context of the value
- Verify pass-through attributes are applied

## Advice

- **Designers**: Use both color and text to communicate the status level, ensuring the display is understandable for users with color vision deficiencies.
- **Developers**: Apply dynamic CSS classes or inline styles based on the `value` prop to color-code the display element appropriately.
