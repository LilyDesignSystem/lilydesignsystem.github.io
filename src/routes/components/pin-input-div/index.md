# PIN Input

A PIN input is a specialized form component that presents a series of
single-character input fields for entering Personal Identification Numbers
(PINs), verification codes, one-time passwords (OTPs), or similar short numeric
codes. Each digit occupies its own input field, creating a segmented entry
experience that clearly communicates the expected code length to the user.

The component automatically advances focus to the next field when a digit is
entered, supports Backspace to move back to the previous field, and allows Arrow
key navigation between fields. The combined value of all digit fields is
available as a single bindable string. This pattern is commonly used in
two-factor authentication flows, SMS verification, and secure PIN entry
interfaces. Each individual input field has an accessible label indicating its
position (e.g., "Digit 1 of 4") to support screen reader users.

## Implementation Notes

- Renders as `<div role="group">` containing individual single-digit `<input>` elements
- Uses reactive state for internal digits array and two-way binding for combined value
- Auto-focuses next input on digit entry
- Backspace in empty input moves focus to previous input
- ArrowLeft/ArrowRight navigate between inputs
- Only accepts numeric characters (0-9)
- `inputmode="numeric"` ensures numeric keyboard on mobile devices
- `maxlength="1"` restricts each input to a single character

## Props

- `label`: string (required) -- accessible label for the group via aria-label
- `length`: number (default: 4) -- number of digit inputs
- `value`: string (default: "") -- bindable combined string of all digits
- `disabled`: boolean (default: false) -- disables all inputs
- `...restProps`: Any additional HTML attributes on the group div

## Usage

Basic 4-digit PIN input:

```html
<PinInput label="Enter PIN" value={pin} />
<p>Entered PIN: {pin}</p>
```

6-digit verification code for two-factor authentication:

```html
<PinInput label="Verification Code" length={6} value={code} />
```

PIN input in a login verification form:

```html
<Form label="Verify your identity" onsubmit={handleVerify}>
  <p>Enter the 6-digit code sent to your phone.</p>
  <Field label="Verification code">
    <PinInput label="Verification code" length={6} value={verificationCode} />
  </Field>
  <Button type="submit">Verify</Button>
  <ActionLink href="/resend">Resend code</ActionLink>
</Form>
```

Disabled state while verifying:

```html
<PinInput label="Verifying code" length={6} value={code} disabled />
<Loading>Verifying...</Loading>
```

## Keyboard Interactions

- Digit entry: enters value and auto-focuses next input
- Backspace: clears current or moves to previous input
- ArrowLeft: focuses previous input
- ArrowRight: focuses next input
- Tab: standard tab navigation in/out of the group

## ARIA

- `role="group"` with `aria-label` on the container
- Each input has `aria-label="Digit X of Y"` for positional context
- `inputmode="numeric"` for numeric keyboard on mobile

## When to Use

- Use for two-factor authentication, SMS verification codes, and OTP entry flows.
- Use when you need a segmented input that clearly communicates the expected code length.
- Use for MFA flows where the user enters a time-based code from an authenticator app.
- Use for account verification during sign-up or password reset.

## When Not to Use

- Do not use for passwords -- use PasswordInput instead.
- Do not use for general numeric entry -- use NumberInput instead.
- Do not use for reference numbers or codes longer than 8 digits -- use TextInput with `inputmode="numeric"` instead.

## Headless

The PinInput headless component provides a `<div role="group">` containing individual `<input>` fields with `inputmode="numeric"`, `maxlength="1"`, per-digit `aria-label` attributes, and auto-focus navigation. The consumer provides all visual styling for the digit fields, spacing, and container layout.


## Styles

The consumer provides all CSS styling. The component renders with a `.pin-input-div` class for targeting. No default styles are included — this is a fully headless component.


## Testing


- Verify the component renders a `<div>` element with class `pin-input-div`
- Verify role="group"` with `aria-label` on the container
- Verify Each input has `aria-label="Digit X of Y"` for positional context
- Verify keyboard interactions work correctly
- Verify pass-through attributes are applied

## Advice

- **Designers**: Space digit fields evenly and make each field large enough for easy touch input; consider visual separators between groups (e.g., after the third digit in a 6-digit code).
- **Developers**: Handle paste events to distribute a pasted code across all digit fields, and auto-submit the form when all digits are entered for a smoother user experience.
