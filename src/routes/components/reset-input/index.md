# Reset Input

A reset input is a UI/UX component that provides a form reset button using the native HTML `<input type="reset">` element. When clicked within a form, it resets all form fields to their initial values. The component supports custom button text through the value prop and can be disabled when form resetting should be prevented.

Reset inputs are useful in forms where users may want to clear all entered data and start over. They rely on the browser's built-in form reset behavior, which restores each field to its default value attribute.

## Implementation Notes

- Renders a single `<input type="reset">` element for native form reset behavior
- The browser automatically handles resetting all sibling form fields when clicked
- Default button text is "Reset", configurable via the `value` prop
- Supports rest props via `...restProps` for extensibility (e.g., `id`, `name`, `class`)
- No ARIA attributes needed beyond the native semantics of `<input type="reset">`

## Props

- `value`: string (default: "Reset") -- the visible button text
- `disabled`: boolean (default: false) -- whether the button is disabled
- `...restProps`: spread onto the `<input>` element

## Usage

Form with submit and reset actions:

```html
<Form label="Registration" onsubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <Field label="Name" required>
    <TextInput label="Name" value={name} required />
  </Field>
  <Field label="Email" required>
    <EmailInput label="Email" value={email} required />
  </Field>
  <SubmitInput value="Register" />
  <ResetInput value="Clear form" disabled={!formDirty} />
</Form>
```

Simple reset with default label:

```html
<ResetInput />
```

## Keyboard Interactions

- Enter: activates the reset button
- Space: activates the reset button

Note: keyboard interactions are provided natively by the `<input type="reset">` element.

## ARIA

No additional ARIA attributes are needed. The native `<input type="reset">` element has an implicit `button` role and the `value` attribute serves as its accessible name.

## When to Use

- Use to provide a form reset button that clears all fields to their default values.
- Use sparingly and only when users genuinely need to start over.
- Use alongside SubmitInput to provide a complete set of form actions.

## When Not to Use

- Do not use as the primary action -- users rarely need to reset; use Button with `type="submit"` for the main action.
- Do not use when data loss would be harmful -- consider a confirmation step via AlertDialog first.
- Do not use on forms with many fields or long workflows, as accidental resets can frustrate users.

## Headless

The ResetInput headless component provides a native `<input type="reset">` with configurable button text via the `value` prop and `disabled` state. The browser handles all form reset behavior natively. The consumer provides all visual styling for the button appearance.


## Styles

The consumer provides all CSS styling. The component renders with a `.reset-input` class for targeting. No default styles are included — this is a fully headless component.


## Testing


- Verify the component renders a `<input>` element with class `reset-input`
- Verify keyboard interactions work correctly
- Verify pass-through attributes are applied

## Advice

- **Designers**: Style the reset button with less visual emphasis than the submit button to reduce accidental clicks, and position it away from the primary action.
- **Developers**: Use the `disabled` prop to disable reset when the form is in its initial state (not dirty), preventing unnecessary resets.
