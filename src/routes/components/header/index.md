# Header

A header is a headless component that renders a semantic `<header>` element, providing a landmark region for introductory or navigational content. It is typically positioned at the top of a page or section and contains elements like headings, navigation links, branding, search controls, or call-to-action buttons.

The semantic `<header>` element helps assistive technologies identify the header region as a landmark, improving navigation for screen reader users. An optional `aria-label` allows consumers to distinguish between multiple headers on a page.

## Implementation Notes

- Renders a single `<header>` element as a semantic landmark
- Uses an optional `aria-label` to provide an accessible name, which is helpful when a page has multiple header regions
- Uses slot for the `children` prop
- Spreads `restProps` onto the header element for consumer extensibility

## Props

- `label`: string (default: undefined) -- optional accessible name applied via `aria-label`, useful for distinguishing multiple headers
- `children`: slot (required) -- content rendered inside the header element
- `...restProps`: unknown -- additional attributes spread onto the header element

## Usage

```html
<Header label="Service name">
  <nav aria-label="Primary navigation">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a></li>
      <li><a href="/patients" aria-current="page">Patients</a></li>
      <li><a href="/appointments">Appointments</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</Header>
```

```html
<!-- Simplified transactional header without navigation -->
<Header label="Register with a GP">
  <span>Register with a GP</span>
</Header>
```

```html
<!-- Section header with aria-label to distinguish from page header -->
<Header label="Article header">
  <h2>Article Title</h2>
  <p>Published on 2024-01-15</p>
</Header>
```

## Keyboard Interactions

None -- this component is a passive container. Keyboard interactions are determined by the content placed inside it by the consumer.

## ARIA

- `aria-label={label}` -- optionally provides an accessible name for the header landmark, useful when multiple headers exist on a page to help screen reader users distinguish between them
- The `<header>` element implicitly has `role="banner"` when it is a direct child of `<body>`, providing a page-level landmark

## When to Use

- Use at the top of every page to identify the service and provide consistent site-wide navigation
- Use to display the service name, logo, and primary navigation links
- Use a simplified header without navigation or search on transactional pages to keep users focused on their task
- Use when the page needs a `banner` landmark for assistive technology navigation
- Use `aria-label` to distinguish section headers from the page header when multiple headers exist on a page

## When Not to Use

- Do not use for page-specific content or actions -- Header is for site-wide identification and navigation only
- Do not use sticky or fixed positioning -- it can obscure content that has keyboard focus (WCAG 2.2)
- Do not use as a replacement for NavigationMenu -- Header contains the navigation, but complex menus should use dedicated components
- Do not nest a header directly inside another header

## Headless

This headless component provides a semantic `<header>` element that automatically exposes the `banner` landmark role (when a direct child of `<body>`) to assistive technologies. The consumer provides all visual styling including layout, background, typography, and spacing.


## Styles

The consumer provides all CSS styling. The component renders with a `.header` class for targeting. No default styles are included — this is a fully headless component.


## Testing


- Verify the component renders a `<header>` element with class `header`
- Verify aria-label={label}` -- optionally provides an accessible name for the header landmark, useful when multiple headers exist on a page to help screen reader users distinguish between them
- Verify The `<header>` element implicitly has `role="banner"` when it is a direct child of `<body>`, providing a page-level landmark
- Verify pass-through attributes are applied

## Advice

- **Designers**: Keep the header visually consistent across pages. Include branding and primary navigation prominently. Use a sticky or fixed position for easy access on long pages.
- **Developers**: When multiple headers exist on a page, provide the `label` prop to help screen reader users distinguish between them.
