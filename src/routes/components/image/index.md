# Image

An image component displays visual content such as photographs, illustrations, or diagrams within an interface. The Image component provides a headless wrapper that ensures proper accessibility through required alt text and optional caption support via the HTML `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements.

When a caption is provided, the component renders a `<figure>` containing the `<img>` and a `<figcaption>`, giving the image semantic association with its description. Without a caption, it renders a plain `<img>` element. The component also supports native lazy loading for performance optimization.

## Implementation Notes

- Renders a plain `<img>` element when no caption is provided
- Renders a `<figure>` with `<img>` and `<figcaption>` when a caption is provided
- The `alt` prop is required to enforce accessibility
- Rest props are spread onto the `<img>` element (no caption) or the `<figure>` element (with caption)
- Supports the native `loading` attribute for lazy/eager loading control

## Props

- `src`: string (required) -- the image source URL
- `alt`: string (required) -- alternative text describing the image for screen readers and when the image fails to load
- `caption`: string (optional) -- when provided, wraps the image in a `<figure>` with a `<figcaption>`
- `loading`: "lazy" | "eager" (optional) -- controls the native browser loading behavior
- `...restProps`: unknown -- additional attributes spread onto the root element

## Usage

```html
<Image
  src="/images/stretch-marks.jpg"
  alt="Close-up of a person's skin showing pink and silver stretch marks across the abdomen"
/>
```

```html
<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/images/chickenpox-rash.jpg"
    alt="Small red spots on a child's chest and arms, typical of chickenpox"
  />
  <Caption>Chickenpox starts with small, itchy spots. They can appear anywhere on the body.</Caption>
</Figure>
```

```html
<!-- Lazy-loaded image below the fold -->
<Image
  src="/images/physiotherapy-exercise.jpg"
  alt="A person performing a seated hamstring stretch with one leg extended"
  loading="lazy"
/>
```

## Keyboard Interactions

None -- this component is a passive content element. Images are not interactive by default.

## ARIA

- `alt="..."` -- provides the accessible name for the image, required for all non-decorative images
- `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` -- when caption is present, these semantic HTML elements associate the caption with the image for assistive technology

## When to Use

- Use when an image meets a genuine user need, such as helping users identify a health condition or understand a procedure
- Use with descriptive alt text that conveys the same information as the image
- Use with a caption (via Figure and Caption) to explain what users should conclude from the image
- Use when users with access needs like dyslexia benefit from visual content alongside text

## When Not to Use

- Do not use decorative images that add no informational value -- they frustrate users, especially on transactional pages; use a CSS background image instead
- Do not use images containing embedded text -- screen readers cannot read text within images
- Do not arrange images side-by-side in a gallery layout -- stack vertically so users do not miss content
- Do not use when the information can be conveyed equally well through text alone

## Headless

This headless component provides an `<img>` element with required `alt` text, optional `<figure>`/`<figcaption>` wrapping, and native `loading` attribute support. The consumer provides all visual styling including sizing, borders, rounded corners, and responsive behavior.


## Styles

The consumer provides all CSS styling. The component renders with a `.image` class for targeting. No default styles are included — this is a fully headless component.


## Testing


- Verify the component renders a `<img>` element with class `image`
- Verify pass-through attributes are applied

## Advice

- **Designers**: Define consistent aspect ratios and sizing for images across the application. Provide placeholder or skeleton states for slow-loading images.
- **Developers**: Always write meaningful `alt` text that describes the image content. Use `loading="lazy"` for below-the-fold images to improve page performance.

## Related components

- `image-file-input` — an input for selecting image files with preview
