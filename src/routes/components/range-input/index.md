# Range Input

A range input is a UI/UX component that provides a slider control for selecting a numeric value within a defined range. It uses the native HTML `<input type="range">` element, which renders as a draggable track and handle. The component supports configurable minimum, maximum, and step values, and provides a bindable value prop for two-way data binding. An aria-label ensures the control is accessible to screen readers and assistive technologies.

Range inputs are commonly used for volume controls, brightness settings, price filters, and any scenario where users need to select a value from a continuous numeric spectrum.

## Implementation Notes

- Renders a single `<input type="range">` element for native slider behavior
- Supports two-way binding for the `value` prop enabling two-way data binding with two-way `value` binding
- Supports rest props via `...restProps` for extensibility (e.g., `id`, `name`, `class`)
- The `aria-label` prop provides an accessible name since there is no visible `<label>` element
- Default value is 50, centered in the default 0-100 range

## Props

- `label`: string (required) -- accessible name applied via `aria-label`
- `value`: number (default: 50) -- current numeric value, bindable with two-way `value` binding
- `min`: number (default: 0) -- minimum allowed value
- `max`: number (default: 100) -- maximum allowed value
- `step`: number (default: 1) -- increment between selectable values
- `disabled`: boolean (default: false) -- whether the input is disabled
- `...restProps`: spread onto the `<input>` element

## Usage

Volume control:

```html
<RangeInput label="Volume" value={volume} min={0} max={100} />
```

Price filter with step increments:

```html
<RangeInput label="Maximum price" value={maxPrice} min={10} max={500} step={10} />
```

Satisfaction rating from 1 to 10:

```html
<RangeInput label="Satisfaction" value={satisfaction} min={1} max={10} step={1} />
```

## Keyboard Interactions

- Left Arrow / Down Arrow: decrease value by one step
- Right Arrow / Up Arrow: increase value by one step
- Home: set to minimum value
- End: set to maximum value
- Page Down: decrease by a larger step (browser-defined)
- Page Up: increase by a larger step (browser-defined)

Note: keyboard interactions are provided natively by the `<input type="range">` element.

## ARIA

- `aria-label={label}` -- provides the accessible name for the slider control since no visible label element is associated

## When to Use

- Use for selecting a value within a defined range using a native HTML range slider.
- Use for approximate value selection like satisfaction ratings, volume, brightness, or price filters.
- Use when the full range should be visually represented and an approximate value is acceptable.
- Use for zoom levels, opacity controls, or any bounded numeric spectrum.

## When Not to Use

- Do not use when exact numbers matter -- use NumberInput instead.
- Do not use for angle selection in degrees -- use AngleSliderRangeInput instead.
- Do not use for a custom slider with non-native styling needs -- use Slider instead.

## Headless

The RangeInput headless component provides a native `<input type="range">` with `aria-label`, configurable `min`, `max`, and `step` values, and two-way value binding. The browser handles all slider keyboard interactions natively. The consumer provides all visual styling for the track, thumb, and labels.


## Styles

The consumer provides all CSS styling. The component renders with a `.range-input` class for targeting. No default styles are included — this is a fully headless component.


## Testing


- Verify the component renders a `<input>` element with class `range-input`
- Verify aria-label={label}` -- provides the accessible name for the slider control since no visible label element is associated
- Verify keyboard interactions work correctly
- Verify pass-through attributes are applied

## Advice

- **Designers**: Display the current value near the slider thumb or in a label, and consider adding tick marks at key intervals for better spatial reference.
- **Developers**: Use the `step` prop to constrain values to meaningful increments, and debounce `oninput` handlers if the slider drives expensive updates.
