# Alert Dialog

An alert dialog is a modal dialog that interrupts the user's workflow to
communicate critical information and require a response. Unlike regular dialogs,
alert dialogs demand immediate attention -- they are used for important warnings,
confirmations of destructive actions, or error conditions that must be
acknowledged before the user can continue.

Alert dialogs are distinguished from standard dialogs by the `alertdialog` ARIA
role, which signals to assistive technologies that the content requires the
user's immediate attention. Common uses include confirming irreversible actions
(e.g., "Delete this item?"), warning about unsaved changes, or displaying
critical error messages that require acknowledgment.

## Implementation Notes

- Uses native HTML `<dialog>` element with the `open` attribute for visibility
- `role="alertdialog"` distinguishes from regular dialogs -- indicates critical content requiring acknowledgment
- two-way binding on the `open` prop for dialog visibility
- Conditionally rendered with conditional rendering to remove from DOM when closed
- `aria-modal="true"` signals modal behavior to assistive technologies
- Title rendered in a `<p><strong>` element, referenced by `aria-labelledby`
- Description rendered in a `<p>` element, referenced by `aria-describedby` when present
- Consumers are responsible for focus trapping and Escape key handling

## Props

- `open`: boolean (default: false, bindable) -- whether the dialog is visible
- `title`: string (required) -- dialog heading, referenced by aria-labelledby
- `description`: string (optional) -- dialog message, referenced by aria-describedby
- `children`: slot -- action buttons and additional content
- `...restProps`: Any additional HTML attributes

## Usage

Destructive action confirmation:

```html
<button onclick={() => showDialog = true}>Remove patient record</button>

<AlertDialog
  open={showDialog}
  title="Remove patient record"
  description="This will permanently delete the patient record and all associated notes. This action cannot be undone."
>
  <button onclick={handleConfirm}>Yes, remove record</button>
  <button onclick={handleCancel}>Cancel</button>
</AlertDialog>
```

Unsaved changes warning:

```html
<AlertDialog
  open={showUnsaved}
  title="Unsaved changes"
  description="You have unsaved changes that will be lost if you leave this page."
>
  <button onclick={handleDiscard}>Discard changes</button>
  <button onclick={handleStay}>Stay on page</button>
</AlertDialog>
```

Simple acknowledgment without description:

```html
<AlertDialog open={showExpired} title="Session expired">
  <button onclick={() => showExpired = false}>OK</button>
</AlertDialog>
```

## Keyboard Interactions

- Escape: Closes the dialog (consumer must implement via onkeydown)
- Tab: Focus should be trapped within the dialog (consumer responsibility)

## ARIA

- `role="alertdialog"`
- `aria-modal="true"`
- `aria-labelledby` references the title element
- `aria-describedby` references the description element (when present)

## When to Use

- Use for urgent messages that require user acknowledgment before they can continue, such as "Are you sure you want to delete this record?"
- Use for destructive action confirmations where the consequence is irreversible or significant.
- Use when the dialog must trap focus and block interaction with the rest of the page until the user responds.
- Use when the ARIA `alertdialog` role is needed to signal critical content to assistive technologies.

## When Not to Use

- Do not use for informational messages that do not need acknowledgment -- use Alert or Banner instead.
- Do not use for complex forms or multi-step workflows -- use Dialog instead.
- Do not use for non-modal overlays or contextual content -- use Popover or HoverCard instead.

## Headless

This component provides `role="alertdialog"`, `aria-modal`, `aria-labelledby`, and `aria-describedby` attributes on a native `<dialog>` element with zero visual styling. The consumer is responsible for all CSS including backdrop overlay, dialog positioning, sizing, padding, button styles, and focus trap implementation.


## Styles

The consumer provides all CSS styling. The component renders with a `.alert-dialog` class for targeting. No default styles are included — this is a fully headless component.


## Testing


- Verify the component renders a `<dialog>` element with class `alert-dialog`
- Verify role="alertdialog"
- Verify aria-labelledby` references the title element
- Verify keyboard interactions work correctly
- Verify pass-through attributes are applied

## Advice

- **Designers**: Ensure the dialog has a clear title, a concise description of the action, and distinguishable confirm/cancel buttons with appropriate visual weight (e.g., a destructive action button should appear more prominent and cautionary).
- **Developers**: The consumer must implement focus trapping and Escape key handling. Set initial focus on the least destructive action button (e.g., "Cancel") to prevent accidental confirmations.

## Related components

- `dialog` — a modal or non-modal dialog window
- `popconfirm-dialog` — a popover dialog with confirm and cancel buttons
- `alert` — a status message for important information or feedback
