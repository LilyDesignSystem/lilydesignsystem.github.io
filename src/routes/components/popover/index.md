# Popover

A popover is a UI component that displays contextual information or actions in an overlay that appears near the element that triggered it. The Popover component provides a headless conditional dialog container that renders its content only when the `open` state is true, with proper dialog semantics for accessibility.

Unlike tooltips, popovers can contain rich interactive content such as text, forms, buttons, or other controls. The component supports two-way binding on the `open` prop, allowing parent components to control visibility. The consumer is responsible for providing trigger elements and managing open/close logic.

## Implementation Notes

- Conditionally renders a `<div>` with `role="dialog"` only when `open` is true
- Supports two-way binding on the `open` prop
- The `label` prop provides the dialog's accessible name via `aria-label`
- Rest props are spread onto the `<div>` element
- The consumer must provide their own trigger element and open/close logic
- Content is provided via the `children` slot

## Props

- `label`: string (required) -- accessible name for the popover dialog via `aria-label`
- `open`: boolean (default: false, bindable) -- controls whether the popover is visible; supports two-way binding
- `children`: slot (required) -- the popover content
- `...restProps`: unknown -- additional attributes spread onto the `<div>` element

## Usage

Basic popover with a toggle trigger:

```html
<button onclick={() => showPopover = !showPopover}>Toggle info</button>
<Popover label="Additional information" open={showPopover}>
  <p>Here is some contextual information.</p>
  <button onclick={() => showPopover = false}>Close</button>
</Popover>
```

Popover with an inline edit form:

```html
<button onclick={() => editOpen = !editOpen}>Edit name</button>
<Popover label="Edit display name" open={editOpen}>
  <form onsubmit={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); saveName(); editOpen = false; }}>
    <label for="display-name">Display name</label>
    <input type="text" id="display-name" value={name} />
    <button type="submit">Save</button>
    <button type="button" onclick={() => editOpen = false}>Cancel</button>
  </form>
</Popover>
```

Popover for a filter panel:

```html
<button onclick={() => filterOpen = !filterOpen}>Filter results</button>
<Popover label="Filter options" open={filterOpen}>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Status</legend>
    <label><input type="checkbox" value="active" /> Active</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" value="archived" /> Archived</label>
  </fieldset>
  <button onclick={() => { applyFilters(); filterOpen = false; }}>Apply</button>
</Popover>
```

## Keyboard Interactions

- Escape: Consumer should implement closing the popover by setting `open` to false
- Tab: Should trap focus within the popover when open (consumer responsibility)

## ARIA

- `role="dialog"` -- identifies the popover as a dialog overlay for assistive technology
- `aria-label="..."` -- provides the accessible name for the dialog

## When to Use

- Use Popover to display rich interactive content like forms, menus, or detailed information near a trigger element.
- Use Popover when the overlay content needs to persist until the user explicitly dismisses it.
- Use Popover for inline editing interfaces, such as editing a profile field without leaving the page.
- Use Popover for filter panels or mini-forms that relate to a specific trigger element.
- Use Popover for contextual actions that need more space than a menu item label.

## When Not to Use

- Do not use for simple descriptive text on hover or focus -- use Tooltip instead.
- Do not use for content requiring a full modal with backdrop overlay -- use Dialog or AlertDialog instead.
- Do not use for preview content triggered by hover -- use HoverCard instead.
- Do not use for navigation menus -- use DropdownMenu or NavigationMenu instead.

## Headless

The Popover headless component provides a conditionally rendered `<div>` with `role="dialog"` and `aria-label` for accessible naming. It handles open/close state via two-way binding. The consumer provides all visual styling, positioning logic, trigger elements, and focus management.


## Styles

The consumer provides all CSS styling. The component renders with a `.popover` class for targeting. No default styles are included — this is a fully headless component.


## Testing


- Verify the component renders a `<div>` element with class `popover`
- Verify role="dialog"` -- identifies the popover as a dialog overlay for assistive technology
- Verify aria-label="..."` -- provides the accessible name for the dialog
- Verify keyboard interactions work correctly
- Verify pass-through attributes are applied

## Advice

- **Designers**: Position popovers to avoid obscuring the trigger element, and ensure the popover has a clear visual boundary (border or shadow) to distinguish it from surrounding content.
- **Developers**: Implement focus trapping within the popover when open, and close it on Escape key press to follow the WAI-ARIA dialog pattern.

## Related components

- `hover-card` — a card that appears on hover over a trigger element
- `tooltip` — a small popup showing descriptive text on hover or focus
- `popconfirm-dialog` — a popover dialog with confirm and cancel buttons
