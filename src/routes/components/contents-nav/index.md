# Contents Nav

A contents list provides a table-of-contents navigation with ordered links to page sections. It helps users quickly scan and jump to different parts of a long page, improving navigation and content discoverability.

This component is commonly used at the top of documentation pages, articles, or forms with multiple sections. It renders a semantic `<nav>` landmark with an ordered list, making the hierarchical structure clear to both visual users and assistive technology. Use ContentsListItem components or `<li>` elements as children.

## Implementation Notes

- Renders a `<nav>` element with `aria-label` for accessible landmark identification
- Contains an `<ol>` (ordered list) to convey the sequential nature of page sections
- Children slot is rendered inside the ordered list
- Label prop is required for accessibility, distinguishing this navigation from others on the page
- Spreads `restProps` on the outer `<nav>` element
- This is a compound component; use with ContentsListItem for individual entries

## Props

- `label`: string (required) -- accessible name for the navigation landmark (e.g., "Contents", "On this page")
- `children`: slot (required) -- list items, typically ContentsListItem components or `<li>` elements with links
- `...restProps`: any additional HTML attributes spread onto the `<nav>` element

## Usage

```html
<ContentsNav label="Pages in this guide">
  <ContentsList>
    <ContentsListItem aria-current="page">
      What is type 2 diabetes?
    </ContentsListItem>
    <ContentsListItem>
      <ContentsLink href="/conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms">Symptoms</ContentsLink>
    </ContentsListItem>
    <ContentsListItem>
      <ContentsLink href="/conditions/type-2-diabetes/getting-diagnosed">Getting diagnosed</ContentsLink>
    </ContentsListItem>
    <ContentsListItem>
      <ContentsLink href="/conditions/type-2-diabetes/treatment">Treatment</ContentsLink>
    </ContentsListItem>
  </ContentsList>
</ContentsNav>
```

## Keyboard Interactions

None -- this component is a passive navigation container. Keyboard navigation is handled natively by the anchor links within list items.

## ARIA

- `aria-label={label}` -- provides an accessible name for the `<nav>` landmark, distinguishing it from other navigation regions on the page

## When to Use

- Use at the top of a page to help users navigate a small group of related pages, such as pages about a health condition.
- Use for collections of up to 8 related pages -- the mini-hub pattern pairs this with PaginationNav at the bottom.
- Use with `aria-label` to describe the navigation purpose, such as "Pages in this guide".

## When Not to Use

- Do not use for unrelated pages that are not part of a cohesive group -- it will confuse users.
- Do not use for hierarchical site navigation -- use BreadcrumbNav instead.
- Do not use for in-page section links on a single long page -- use anchor links with a table of contents pattern.
- Do not use within multi-page forms -- use Button with BackLink for form step navigation.

## Headless

This headless ContentsNav component provides a semantic `<nav>` element with `aria-label` for landmark identification, containing an `<ol>` for ordered section links. The consumer provides all visual styling including positioning (sticky sidebar or inline), borders, spacing, and link appearance.


## Styles

The consumer provides all CSS styling. The component renders with a `.contents-nav` class for targeting. No default styles are included — this is a fully headless component.


## Testing


- Verify the component renders a `<nav>` element with class `contents-nav`
- Verify aria-label={label}` -- provides an accessible name for the `<nav>` landmark, distinguishing it from other navigation regions on the page
- Verify pass-through attributes are applied

## Advice

- **Designers**: Place the contents navigation in a consistent location, such as the top of the content area or a sticky sidebar. Ensure it is visually distinct from the main navigation.
- **Developers**: Set the `label` prop to a descriptive name (e.g., "On this page") to differentiate this landmark from other `<nav>` elements. Use ContentsList and ContentsListItem as children.

## Composition

ContentsNav follows the Nav/List/ListItem composition pattern. Use ContentsNav as the outer `<nav>` landmark, ContentsList as the inner ordered list, and ContentsListItem for each section link entry. This three-level structure ensures proper semantics and landmark navigation for assistive technology users.

## Related components

- `contents-list` — an contents ordered list of contents list item components
- `contents-list-item` — one contents list item
- `contents-link` — one table of contents link
